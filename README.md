# üêù Honey production US analysis 
This project has a special importance for me because my father became an amateur beekeeper a few years ago. Thanks to him, I really 
understood this most interesting insect and why it is so important for humankind.<br><br>
The data come from Kevin Zmith on Kaggle, inspired by the dataset Honey Production in the USA, extended to the period 1998-2017. Additionnaly, the data from 
USGS's Pesticide National Synthesis Project has been agregated, allowing evaluation of the statistical connections between Honey 
Production and the use of Neonicotinoid (neonic) pesticides. <br><br>
This project analyses the honey production in the US, the evolution of the price and the number of colonies and the relation between 
the use of Neonicotinoid pesticides and the fall of honeybees colonies.<br><br>
